pinch,2,"You imbue your fingers with supernatural strength. For the next minute, you can effortlessly pick up and move objects of any weight, as long as you can reasonably handle their size and shape. For instance, you might pinch the shirt of a bully and raise them up in the air or casually move a giant anvil.",trickery,,WIZARD,2
stretch,0,"<div>
  <span class=""ap"">2</span> Choose a nearby creature or object that is no smaller than an ant and no larger than a horse. You cause it to instantly enlarge or shrink. It can grow up to twice its size or shrink up to half of its size. The target's weight increases or decreases proportionally, but its
hit points do not change. You cannot enlarge something beyond the confines of the space it's in.
</div>
 <div>
  <span class=""ap"">4</span> You may stretch an object no smaller than an ant and no larger than an elephant.

undo,0,"You speak a word of power, reversing the fate of a nearby object. The spell cannot be used to affect living things.<br><br>
The thing you are undoing must be the discrete result of another creature's effort. For example, you might undo
a creature's shoelaces, unthread a garment, cause a piece of furniture
to fall apart, or revert a sculpture to a block of marble..<br><br>
Choose how much effort to undo each time you use this spell:
 <div>
  <span class=""ap"">1</span> Up to 1 minute of effort.

 <div>
  <span class=""ap"">2</span> Up to 1 day of effort.

rift,5,"You summon a magnificent gateway that contains a portal to your current universe's nexus in The Rift. (The Rift is a special location in the omniverse, which you can read more about on p. 33) Each universe's gateway is unique; it might be a stone archway, an iron gate, a humble wooden door, or something else. The Guide imagines what this gateway looks like.<br><br>
This is an extraordinarily difficult portal to maintain, and it only remains open for 1 minute. Once opened, any creatures or objects that can fit through the portal may pass through it.<br><br>
While you may summon access to the gateway anywhere, the exit point remains in the same location in The Rift.",legendary,,WIZARD,1
transcendence,5,"You embark on an incredible quest for knowledge within living things. For the next minute, you enter a trance as your consciousness expands, touching all sentient beings within 1,000 kilometers of you.<br><br>
The ordeal is staggering. You immediately sense time and personal identity at a scale beyond your normal understanding. You absorb the simultaneous experiences of others — possibly from billions of beings.<br><br>
Your knowledge quest must be limited to a subject that you could reasonably come to understand by seeing through the eyes of others. For instance, you may set out to learn the true history of a species, identify who and where the most powerful being is, discover the location of a secret object, or become generally accustomed to the beliefs and practices of a culture. You cannot use the spell for things that one mind could not reasonably possess (for instance, by asking for “all the world’s knowledge""). The Guide will decide if your request is reasonable.<br><br>
Beware. Entering the minds of others is risky.<br><br>
You may experience unforeseen consequences...",legendary,,WIZARD,2
planecraft,0,"You conjure a shadow plane. Its contents are completely illusory and cannot leave the plane. You can fill it with anything you can imagine, except sentient beings.<br><br>
The things inside may look and feel real, but they are ultimately mirages. Creatures cannot be harmed by things you put in this plane.
 <div>
  <span class=""ap"">2</span> You conjure a tiny plane no larger than a mansion or castle.
</div> 
 <div>
  <span class=""ap"">4</span> You conjure a plane no larger than the size of a village.
</div> 
 <div>
  <span class=""ap"">6</span> You conjure a plane with no size limit.
</div> 
 <div>
  <span class=""ap"">8</span> You conjure a plane with no size limit and no safeguards. Creatures can now be harmed by the things you put in the plane. (That includes you.)

create,5,"You tap raw magic, converting its energy into a single, non-magical, inanimate object that fits inside a cube no larger than 5 meters in any dimension. You create the object perfectly and it is real in every sense. You may create anything that fits in the space, including precious gems, flawless weapons, or exact replicas of other objects.<br><br>
This spell requires perfection and is extremely taxing on your ability as
a Wizard. Keep track of how many times you have cast the spell on
your inventory sheet. The spell's cost increases by 1 AP each time you use it.",legendary,,WIZARD,4
